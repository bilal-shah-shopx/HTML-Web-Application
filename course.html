                <strong><ins>Adobe Photoshop</ins></strong> is a raster graphics editor developed and published by Adobe
                Systems for macOS and Windows. Photoshop was created in 1988 by Thomas and John Knoll. Since then, it has
                become the de facto industry standard in raster graphics editing, such that the word "photoshop" has become
                a verb as in "to Photoshop an image," "photoshopping" and "photoshop contest", though Adobe discourages such
                use.
